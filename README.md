    Analyzing the Correlation Between Music Preferences and Emotional States


     
        Project Overview

The relationship between music and emotions is a complex and intriguing subject. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve been curious about how my music preferences may reflect or influence my emotional state. This project aims to analyze my Spotify listening data over the course of a year and explore potential correlations between my music choices and emotional state. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between my listening behavior and emotional well-being, which could provide deeper insights into how music affects mood.

        Motivation

Music is a reflection of our emotional state and a tool to shape it. This project is driven by personal curiosity to understand how my Spotify listening history connects to emotional trends. By analyzing features like valence (positivity) and energy, I hope to identify patterns in my music choices and explore how they align with potential emotional shifts over the year.

        Dataset Sources

The project will rely entirely on Spotify data:

Spotify Listening History (Personal Data):
    Contains information such as:
        -Tracks, artists, and albums I listened to.
        -Timestamps of when each song was played.
        -Listening duration for each track.

Spotify API Features:
    Spotify API will provide detailed audio features for each track, including:
        -Valence: Positivity of the track.
        -Energy: Perceived energy level of the track.
        -Tempo: Speed of the music (beats per minute).
        -Danceability: How suitable the track is for dancing.
        -Loudness: Overall loudness in decibels.
    
        Objectives

1. Analyze Listening Patterns:
    -Identify monthly, weekly, and daily trends in music preferences.
    -Determine the most listened-to artists, tracks, and genres over time.

2. Understand Emotional Connections:
    -Use Spotify API features (e.g., valence, energy) to explore how music characteristics correlate with potential emotional states.

3. Explore Trends in Audio Features:
    -Analyze shifts in valence and energy levels over the year to identify how my emotional tone may have varied with my music choices.

       Tools and Techniques

Spotify API: 
-To extract audio features for each track in my listening history.
-To retrieve additional metadata (e.g., genre, album information).

Python:
- Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for statistical analysis and potential correlation modeling.

Data Structure:
    The data will be structured as a single dataset combining:
        -Listening history (from Spotify account export).
        -Audio features (from Spotify API).


        Expected Outcomes

1. Trends in Listening Habits:
-Monthly and weekly trends showing how music preferences evolve over time.
-Most listened-to tracks, artists, and genres.

2. Emotional Insights from Music Features:
-Analysis of how features like valence, energy, and tempo change over time.
-Insights into potential emotional patterns derived from music characteristics.

3. Visualizations:
-Heatmaps showing correlations between music features and potential emotional trends.
-Monthly breakdowns of valence, energy, and genre preferences.

        Future Plans

1. Personalized Recommendations:
- Using the findings, I may design a system suggesting tracks or genres based on identified patterns in my listening behavior.

2.Extending the Analysis:
-Explore larger datasets or include data from other platforms for a broader perspective.

3.Potential Applications:
-Insights from this project could contribute to mood-based music recommendation systems or studies on music therapy's impact on emotions.

        Conclusion

This project explores the fascinating intersection of music and emotions, aiming to uncover patterns in music preferences and their connection to emotional states. By analyzing a year of Spotify listening data alongside mood-related factors, it provides a unique opportunity to apply data science techniques to real-world data. The findings from this analysis could not only deepen our understanding of personal listening habits but also inspire broader applications, such as mood-based music recommendations or insights into emotional well-being. Ultimately, this project bridges personal curiosity with meaningful outcomes, showcasing how music and data can together enrich our understanding of human emotions.
