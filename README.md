    Analyzing the Correlation Between Music Preferences and Emotional States
  Project Overview

The relationship between music and emotions is a complex and intriguing subject. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve been curious about how my music preferences may reflect or influence my emotional state. This project aims to analyze my Spotify listening data over the course of a year and explore potential correlations between my music choices and emotional state, using external data sources such as weather and mood tracking. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between my listening behavior and emotional well-being, which could provide deeper insights into how music affects mood and vice versa.

Motivation

Music profoundly influences and reflects human emotions. This project explores how music preferences shift with emotional states over a year, driven by personal curiosity and questions like: Do we choose happier songs during certain seasons? How do factors like weather affect our music choices? Understanding these patterns can provide deeper insights into emotional well-being and even inspire personalized music recommendations or mental health applications.

Dataset Sources

Spotify Listening Data (Existing): I will use my own Spotify listening history, which includes information such as tracks, artists, genres, listening times, and durations.
Spotify Audio Features: Using the Spotify API, I will extract features like valence (mood), energy, and tempo for each track, which can be useful for determining the emotional tone of the music.
External Mood Data:
Weather Data: I plan to include weather information for the corresponding days (e.g., sunshine, rain, temperature) to see if environmental factors affect music choices.
Mood Tracking: I will track my own mood using a mobile app or manual logging to capture how my emotional state correlates with the music I listen to.
Social Media Sentiment: Optionally, I could aggregate mood data from social media (e.g., Twitter sentiment analysis) for a broader view of societal mood during specific periods.
Objectives

Analyze my Spotify listening habits over the past year, focusing on trends in the music I listen to (genres, artists, tracks).
Investigate the correlation between emotional states and music choices, using audio features like valence (mood), energy, and tempo.
Explore how external factors, like weather or personal mood logs, correlate with my listening preferences.
Visualize the relationship between my music preferences and emotional well-being over time.
Tools and Techniques

Spotify API: To gather detailed listening history and extract audio features (e.g., valence, energy, tempo) of tracks.
Python:
Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for statistical analysis and potential correlation modeling.
External Data Sources:
OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
Sentiment analysis tools for social media data (optional).
Manual Mood Tracking: Using a mobile app like Daylio or a custom log to track emotional states over time.
Jupyter Notebooks for iterative analysis and visualizations.
Expected Outcomes

Insights into the Relationship Between Music and Emotions: I expect to find patterns in how my music preferences shift with my mood, potentially identifying specific genres or artists I listen to when feeling a certain way.
Visualizations: Monthly trends in music preferences, showing correlations between emotional states and listening habits. Visualizations will include bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying potential correlations between my emotional state (from mood logs and weather data) and music features such as valence (mood), tempo, and energy.
Personalized Music Recommendations: Based on findings, I might be able to build a system or algorithm to suggest music based on predicted emotional states.
Future Plans

Build a Mood-Based Music Recommendation System: Based on the findings, I plan to implement a simple recommendation system that suggests music based on predicted emotional states or environmental factors.
Expand the Analysis: Eventually, I could apply this analysis to larger datasets or more people to see if similar patterns emerge on a larger scale.
Refine Mood Tracking: I might explore more advanced tools for mood tracking to further enhance the emotional insights derived from the music preferences.
This project not only satisfies my curiosity about the intersection of music and emotions, but also serves as an opportunity to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to real-world data, with potential applications in personalized music recommendations and emotional well-being.
