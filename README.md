    Seasonal Mood Analysis Through Spotifty Listening History
  Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze my emotional state over the past three years based on the music genres I listened to during each months of the past three years. By examining the emotional properties of the songs I frequently played in different seasons, this analysis seeks to uncover patterns between my music preferences and mood fluctuations.
  Motivation:
Music is deeply connected to emotions, and exploring this relationship through my Spotify listening history will provide valuable personal insights. Actually, I do not remember how I felt in these periods of my life. The findings may help understand how music genres and moods correlate with specific times of the year and whether music preferences adapt to seasonal changes.
  Dataset:
The dataset is extracted from my Spotify listening history. I got it from Spotify Privacy Settings. The dataset contains song title, artist, playback date and time, playback duration, playlists, listening history for the past year etc. 
  Project Goals and Plans:
1. Organize playback data by season and year. Categorize songs by their genres.
2. Use Spotify API to obtain emotinal attributes of songs. Analyze mood trends over time based on these attributes.
3. Create visual representations of mood fluctuations across seasons. Highlight the relationship between genres and emotional states.
4. Explore how music genres and emotions vary with specific times of the year. Identify any seasonal patterns or trends in listening preferences.
